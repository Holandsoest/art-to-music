        - size:     relates to the volume, this is an integer between 20 - 100 (change to 0 - 255)
        - color:    relates to the bpm, this is an int with table of 60 - 120. steps of 15
        - x_axis:   relates to the placement of the note in the bar. Number between 0 - 4 steps of 0.25
        - y_axis:   relates to the pitch, this is the y_axis middle point of the shape
